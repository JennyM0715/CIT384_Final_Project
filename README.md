Our group has decided to create a website, specifically a Mexican cuisine restaurant (Mexicanology) using Vue.js--JavaScript framework. Here on this website, people can see what we are all about, what dishes we serve for appetizers, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. People can also see what type of drinks can be served with their meals as well as what desserts we offer for those who crave sweets. We also have a contact us page so that people can give us feedback on how we can improve our hospitality. Lastly, people can sign up with us to receive email notices from us for offers and special events!

The Contact Us and Sign Up page will have a Google recaptcha and use smtp.js (Send email from Javascript). When a user clicks on the green button on either page("send message" or "sign up") the user will be redirected back to the home page and see a toast notification indicating that their information has been submitted and recieved.
